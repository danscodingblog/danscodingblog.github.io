	<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a professional programmer in my late 30's. I studied computer science at UC Berkeley and then spent years working in industry. I learned all about search engines and web developement. Now I run websites that I coded myself. Some of my other hobbies are music and video games. I was a master-level cannon rusher in starcraft 2! And I still love to play old infinity engine games like baldurs gate 2 and icewind dale.</p>
  <p>I made this blog as a place to talk about programming topics and other things that are relevant to my interests. I hope that you enjoy my blog!</p>
